            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p> Learning to code, more slowly than I'd like. </p> <br/>


            <p>I've done an unlikely number of things personally and professionally, from building boats to
                managing a vintage musical instrument and hi-fi store,
                marketing copywriting to writing music and pop culture criticism. </p> <br/>


            <p>After being displaced professionally by COVID and having a spanner thrown in the works by an MS
                diagnosis,
                I studied project management and earned my CAPM. Now I'm learning to write code as both a bankable
                skill
                and a means to see an app idea or two through to fruition.</p> <br/>


            <p>I like to make things. As a musician and tinkerer, I assemble and play many of my own instruments,
                and had performances televised by the BBC
                as part of the Experimental Instrument Orchestra in the aughts. Before that, I played guitar and
                wrote minimalist noisy rock music as one fourth
                of Esau. These days I continue to tinker with building oddball noisemakers, and occassionally make a
                bit of film music.</p> <br/>


            <p>I am a single father of four delightful human beings ranging in age from 33 to 8 and a half.</p> <br/>
